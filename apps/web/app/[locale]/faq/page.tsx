              <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                The accuracy of tarot readings depends on your interpretation
                and how well you connect with the cards' messages. Mystic Tarot
                uses authentic tarot card meanings and spreads that have been
                used for centuries. While we use digital technology to shuffle
                and draw cards, the wisdom and symbolism remain the same as
                traditional physical tarot decks. The cards offer insights and
                perspectives—it's up to you to apply them to your specific
                situation.

                What is a three-card spread?
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                A three-card spread is one of the most popular tarot layouts. In
                Mystic Tarot, the three cards represent Past, Present, and
                Future. The first card reveals influences from your past that
                led to your current situation. The second card shows your
                present circumstances and current energies. The third card
                indicates potential future outcomes based on your current path.
                This spread provides a comprehensive overview while remaining
                simple enough for beginners to understand.

                What does it mean when a card is reversed?
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                In tarot, a reversed card (upside down) typically indicates that
                the card's energy is blocked, internalized, or manifesting in a
                challenging way. Reversed cards can suggest delays, internal
                conflicts, or the need to look at a situation from a different
                perspective. They're not necessarily negative—they often
                highlight areas where growth or awareness is needed. Mystic
                Tarot provides detailed interpretations for both upright and
                reversed positions.

                Can I ask the same question multiple times?
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                While you technically can, it's generally not recommended in
                tarot tradition. If you receive a reading you don't like, asking
                the same question repeatedly (called "reading shopping") can
                create confusion rather than clarity. Instead, take time to
                reflect on the reading you received, consider its message, and
                if needed, rephrase your question to seek different perspectives
                or ask follow-up questions after some time has passed.

              <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                The Major Arcana consists of 22 cards (0-21) representing
                significant life themes, spiritual lessons, and major events or
                turning points. These cards include well-known images like The
                Fool, The Magician, and The World. The Minor Arcana contains 56
                cards divided into four suits (Wands, Cups, Swords, Pentacles),
                representing day-to-day events, challenges, and opportunities.
                Major Arcana cards typically indicate more important or
                transformative experiences, while Minor Arcana cards relate to
                everyday situations and influences.

                Each suit in the Minor Arcana corresponds to different aspects
                of life: Wands represent passion, creativity, action, and
                ambition; Cups symbolize emotions, relationships, love, and
                intuition; Swords signify thoughts, communication, conflicts,
                and decision-making; Pentacles (or Coins) relate to material
                matters, finances, work, and physical health. Understanding
                these associations helps you interpret the cards more deeply.

                Tarot readings are designed for entertainment and
                self-reflection purposes. While they can offer valuable insights
                and perspectives, they should not replace professional advice
                for important decisions. For matters involving health, legal
                issues, or financial planning, always consult qualified
                professionals. Use tarot as a tool for introspection and
                personal growth, but remember that you have the power and
                responsibility to make your own choices.

                Tarot doesn't predict a fixed, unchangeable future. Instead, it
                shows potential outcomes based on current energies and paths.
                The future is not set in stone—your choices and actions can
                influence what happens next. Think of tarot as showing you
                possibilities and tendencies rather than certainties. The power
                to shape your destiny ultimately lies with you.
