              Our Philosophy
            </h2>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              At Mystic Tarot, we understand that tarot reading is more than
              just fortune-telling—it's a tool for self-reflection,
              introspection, and personal growth. Each card in the tarot deck
              carries symbolic meanings that have been refined over centuries,
              representing universal human experiences, challenges, and
              triumphs. When you draw cards through our platform, you're not
              just receiving random predictions; you're engaging with archetypal
              imagery and wisdom that can help illuminate your path forward.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              We believe that tarot readings should be used as a complementary
              tool for self-discovery and reflection rather than as definitive
              life decisions. The cards offer perspectives and insights that can
              help you think more deeply about your situation, consider
              different angles, and make more informed choices. Our approach
              emphasizes empowerment—reminding you that while the cards can
              offer guidance, you ultimately hold the power to shape your own
              destiny.
